title: <Slot />

This component should only be rendered inside a `_layout.tsx` file, where it will serve as the location that children will render for routes below the layout.

This is the simplest option for rendering children, it does not create a Stack, Drawer, or Tab view, instead it just renders the children directly.

```tsx
import { Slot } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Slot />
  )
}
```
