title: useActiveParams
---

This will return the segments of the current URL paths, including dynamic path segments. 

Note that this function, as opposed to [useParams](/docs/hooks-useParams), will update even when the path is not relevant to the route it is used inside. In general when you need to access params , use `useParams`, as these will only
 update when the route is focused.

This hook is useful for things like analytics where you need to access every change globally.
