title: one serve
---

Serve your web apps for production with `one serve`, after you've successfully run `one build`.

It takes the following arguments:

```bash
--host          # string, set the hostname to bind to
--port          # string, set the port to bind to
--platform      # node | vercel, instructs Hono server to use adapter
--compress      # boolean, enable gzip compression, defaults to true
--cacheHeaders  # boolean, sets no-cache headers, defaults to true
```

One comes with a serve command that is powered by [Hono](https://hono.dev).

The compress flag is default on and uses [compress](https://hono.dev/docs/middleware/builtin/compress).

If cacheHeaders is not set to false, it will set this by default:

```tsx
if (!c.req.header('Cache-Control')) {
  c.header('Cache-Control', 'no-store')
  c.header('Vary', '*')
}
```

This is mostly because Safari can aggressively cache things, even with query strings. We highly recommend using a CDN for your static assets, but you can set this to false or use the plugin to [hook into `server.beforeStart`](/docs/configuration) and set your own `Cache-Control` headers.
