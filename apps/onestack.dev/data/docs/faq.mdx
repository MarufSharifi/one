### Is this production ready?

No. We think it's fun to work with already, but if you are doing anything more than an experiment, we'd recommend
using more [proven technology](https://tamagui.dev/takeout) ðŸ˜‰.

### What's breaking?

Testing, hot reloading, and general node module [compatibility](/docs/configuration#deps) need work.

See the [Status documentation](/docs/status) for more.

### Is this on Metro? Is it Expo Router?

No, One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) to test and improve [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev). To test that we ported [tamagui.dev](https://tamagui.dev) to it and enjoyed it.

To make that port work well we added [render modes](/docs/routing-modes), [loaders](/docs/routing-loader), [middlewares](/docs/routing-middlewares), a lot of configuration to make a large amount of node_modules work, a CLI, a production Hono server, and some other [smaller features](/docs/features).

### Why Vite?

It feels light and simple, runs fast and is easy to customize. It tree shakes pricely, has tons of web features done really well, ViteÂ shines in all the details like types, documentation, type-docs, RFCs, and especially community and ecoystem.

### Will you support RSC?

In the best case scenario, we'd like to build our apps as though they were completely client-side, and have smart tools and libraries make them work fast. Mostly-client-side apps are great.

We do have [SSR](/docs/)

We think  helps avoid a lot of framework bloat, so we want to see if we can make a simpler to maintain framework by keeping our core light.

### What's the npm package?

It's `one`, thanks to Dan Maier.
