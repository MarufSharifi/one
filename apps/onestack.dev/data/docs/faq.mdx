### Why Vite?

It feels light and simple, runs fast and is easy to customize. It tree shakes well, has tons of web features, and has best-in-class types, documentation, type-docs, RFCs and community. It also has a huge ecoystem and responsive team.

### Is this production ready?

No. We think it's fun to work with already, and web is close to stable, but Native needs around half a year to get to stable. If you're planning on launching soon, we'd recommend
using more [proven technology](https://tamagui.dev/takeout).

### What's breaking?

Testing, hot reloading, and general node module [compatibility](/docs/configuration#deps) need work.

See the [Status documentation](/docs/status) for more.

### Is this on Metro? Is it Expo Router?

No, One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) to test and improve [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev). To test that we ported [tamagui.dev](https://tamagui.dev) to it and enjoyed it.

To make that port work well we added [render modes](/docs/routing-modes), [loaders](/docs/routing-loader), [middlewares](/docs/routing-middlewares), a lot of configuration to make a large amount of node_modules work, a CLI, a production Hono server, and some other [smaller features](/docs/features).

### Will you support RSC?

In the best case scenario, we'd like to build our apps as though they were completely client-side, and have smart tools and libraries make them work fast. Mostly-client-side apps are great.

We do have [SSR](/docs/)

We think  helps avoid a lot of framework bloat, so we want to see if we can make a simpler to maintain framework by keeping our core light.

### What's the npm package?

It's `one`, thanks to Dan Maier.
