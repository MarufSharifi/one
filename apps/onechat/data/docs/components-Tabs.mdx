title: <Tabs />
---

This component should only be rendered inside a `_layout.tsx` file, where it will serve as the location that children will render for routes below the layout.

Tabs is simply a [React Navigation Bottom Tabs view](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator) and accepts the same props as React Navigation.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Tabs />
  )
}
```

<Notice>
  Adding a new tab route has a bug currently that can cause it to not show up until you re-run your app with `--clean`.
