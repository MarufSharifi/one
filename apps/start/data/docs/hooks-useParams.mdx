title: useParams
---

Returns an object that describes the route segments. This will only update for the route it's used inside of,
and avoids re-renders when, for example, a user navigates to another stack view that isn't matched.

This is the recommended way to access the URL parameters. If you need to access parameters across all routes, see [useActiveParams](/docs/hooks-useActiveParams).
