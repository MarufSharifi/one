title: <Drawer />

<Notice>
  Notice - Drawer is current disabled as we work through a final issue with react-native-gesture-handler. It should be landing very shortly.
</Notice>

This component should only be rendered inside a `_layout.tsx` file, where it will serve as the location that children will render for routes below the layout.

Drawer is simply a [React Navigation Drawer view](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator) and accepts the same props as React Navigation.

```tsx
import { Drawer } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Drawer />
  )
}
```
