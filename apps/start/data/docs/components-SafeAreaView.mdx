title: <SafeAreaView />

Exports SafeAreaView from [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context). This enables easy "safe area" targeting for both web and native.

One uses the [SafeAreaProvider from React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/elements/#safeareaprovidercompat) to set this up.

We're working on improving this so you can control whether it is included and the initial window metrics on server.
